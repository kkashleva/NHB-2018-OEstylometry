This folder contains material salient to the authors' response to Plechac et al., particularly in the realm of nominal compounds.


FILES
-----
TXT documents:
	- calgary_proce_x.txt: The Old English verse corpus used by both sets of authors
	
	- Plechac_found_compounds.txt: The compounds identified by Plechac et al., containing 				  numerous errors as documented in the rebuttal. This file is the last output of the Jupyter notebook 		  titled 'shared_compounds_rebuttal.ipynb'. From the rebuttal, errors marked with line numbers can easily 	  be checked against the original poems to confirm that they are indeed errors. 

	- comploc_clean.txt: An alternative presentation of the compounds found by the original authors in the 		  original Nature Human Behavior paper. Not necessary to understand the rebuttal, simply an ancillary 		  document to help locate compounds and identify hapax legomena. 

Jupyter notebooks:
	- shared_compounds_rebuttal.ipynb: The same Jupyter notebook Plechec et al. submitted, with a command 		  added at the end to extract the TXT document "Plechac_found_compounds.txt", and an extra cell added to 	  create Figure 1 in the rebuttal showing that the prior calculated by Plechac et al. varies wildly from 	  our own, likely due to the errors in their code.
